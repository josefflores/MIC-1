mic1Until I (Jay McCarthy Proffessor at UMASS Lowell) can contact the original authors, it is unclear how this code should be licensed, but it has been historically freely shared with UMass Lowell students taking 91.305, so I suspect an open-source license will be acceptable.

This repository contains tools for working with the MIC-1 system and
is primarily used for the UMass Lowell 91.305 course.

masm - assembler
 mcc - microcode compiler
mic1 - simulator
 rkt - tools rewritten in Racket

The code was written over the years by
- Jim Canning
- Jim Canning's students
- Richard Boccuzzi
- Bill Moloney
(subsequent authors will not be added to this list, but will be
reflected in the Git logs)
